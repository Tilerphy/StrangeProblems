1. The Saml2 Response has a hard sequence.
<Response>
<Issuer></Issuer>
<Signature><Signature>
<Status></Status>
<Assertion></Assertion>
</Response>

2. <Signature><Signature> under the Response is optional, but if you append it, you must ensure these:
(1) SignXml is the sugguestion.
(2) XmlDsigEnvelopedSignatureTransform and XmlDsigExcC14NTransform should be appended into Reference with Algorithm = "http://www.w3.org/2000/09/xmldsig#enveloped-signature" and 
Algorithm = "http://www.w3.org/2001/10/xml-exc-c14n#"

XmlDsigExcC14NTransform is seemded like the MUST one.
(3) URI of Reference is the <Response> attribute "ID" with prepended "#"
(4) Do not change the XML after generated the signature.

3. Encrypt the Assertion with the public key of Relying Party setting.
4. Sign the Assertion/Response with the private key of yourself as a Identity Provider.
5. Microsoft.IdentityModel for JWT/OIDC and the System.IdentityModel for Saml2, but System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt.JwtSecurityTokenHandler could help to validate the JWT with
JWKS directly.

6. Org.BouncyCastle is good at PEM and ECC.
